# shinyBSEM
This Shiny app enables researchers to visualize structural equation models (SEMs) and use this visualization to easily specify prior distributions and subsequently run a Bayesian analysis using blavaan. Currently, this app is still under development, so please send bugs or comments to [Sara van Erp](mailto:sara.vanerp@gmail.com).
